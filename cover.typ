Dear hiring committee,

#v(1em)

I am excited to apply for the post-doctoral assistant position and continue on my academic path in the Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics department.
I will defend my PhD thesis by the end of June 2025, bringing to an end nearly four years of research into both the practical and theoretical aspects of debuggers and programming languages more broadly.

I have enjoyed my time at the department and still have many projects I would like to pursue in collaboration with my colleagues.
I am especially interested in applying my expertise in debuggers to more broader automated testing and verification methods. //, while maintaining a strong emphasize on high quality software artifacts.

Invaluable during my PhD, were the many opportunities to attend conferences and build a network within the international research community.
I am proud of the large number of presentations I have given at these conferences, and at the bottom of the resume I have included for each scientific publication, the formal venues were I had the opportunity to present the work.
As co-organizer of latest Workshop on Future Debugging Techniques (DEBT'25), I hope to further help disseminate and popularize research into novel debugging techniques.

Likewise did I find the teaching duties within the department invaluable.
Teaching both bachelor and master courses, has taught me a lot too.
I especially enjoyed the one-on-one tutoring of master thesis students, and lately, found a passion for helping the new doctoral students in the lab get started with their research.
The latter is another major motivations to apply for this position, as is my involvement with the upcoming reform of the computer science bachelor and master programs. I hope this position gives me the opportunity to contribute further to the department in these areas.

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application in further detail.

Sincerely, \
Tom Lauwaerts
